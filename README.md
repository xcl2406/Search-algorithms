The A* (A-star) algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. It is widely used in applications like:

- Game development (for AI pathfinding)

- Robotics (navigation)

- Network routing

- Map-based route planning (e.g., Google Maps)<br>

üîç What is A* trying to do?
- A* finds the shortest path between a start node and a goal node in a graph while minimizing cost (e.g., time, distance, energy, etc.).

- It improves on Dijkstra's algorithm by using heuristics to guide the search.



üß† Core Idea

> A* selects the next node to explore based on:

    f(n)=g(n)+h(n)

Where:

- g(n): cost from the start to node 
  
- h(n): estimated cost from node n to the goal (this is the heuristic)
  
- f(n): total estimated cost of the cheapest path through n

ü™ô Greedy Algorithm

The Greedy Algorithm is a popular optimization strategy in computer science and mathematics. It is commonly applied in:

- Resource selection and scheduling (e.g., Huffman coding)

- Scheduling problems

- Knapsack problem

- Set cover problem

- Network design (e.g., Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra...)

üîç What is Greedy trying to do?
The Greedy algorithm builds up a solution step by step, always choosing the best option available at the moment, hoping that these local optimum choices will lead to a global optimum solution.

üß† Core Idea
Greedy works under the principle:

- At each step, pick the best possible option without reconsidering previous decisions.

- Unlike A* or Dynamic Programming, Greedy does not backtrack or revise its choices.

üìå Key Characteristics
- Fast and simple

- Doesn't always yield the optimal solution unless the problem satisfies:

- The Greedy-choice property

- Optimal substructure

üì¶ Classic Examples
- Prim's/Kruskal's Algorithm (for Minimum Spanning Tree)

üß≠ Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental algorithm for searching or traversing graphs and trees. It is widely used in:

- Social networks (e.g., finding the shortest connection between people)

- Web crawling

- Solving puzzles (like mazes)

- Routing and network broadcasting

üîç What is BFS trying to do?
- BFS explores a graph level by level starting from a given source node.
- Its goal is to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from the start node to all other nodes in an unweighted graph.

üß† Core Idea
BFS uses a queue (FIFO ‚Äì First In, First Out) to keep track of nodes to visit next.

At each step, it:

- Dequeues the current node

- Explores all its unvisited neighbors

- Enqueues those neighbors

- Repeats until the target is found (or all nodes are visited)

üõ†Ô∏è Key Properties
- Complete: Yes (it always finds a solution if one exists)

- Optimal: Yes (in unweighted graphs)

- Time Complexity: O(V + E), where V = vertices, E = edges

- Space Complexity: O(V), due to storing visited nodes and queue

üì¶ Real-world Use Cases
- Finding shortest paths in unweighted maps

- Solving puzzles like sliding tiles or Rubik‚Äôs cube

- Peer-to-peer networks (e.g., BitTorrent)

- Broadcasting in networked systems
